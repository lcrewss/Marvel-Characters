# Marvel-Characters


*Marvel!  What is there not to like....*

This application is designed to give the user an informative description of their desired character. 

First page is a display page which user must press "Enter" to achieve access. 
As the user scrolls down the list of characters, they chose their desired name. 
Upon selecting their character an image and description of the character will populate below along with the characters comics book covers
which that specific character is in. 

Notice as the page is loaded, I added a gif loader for user interactin while the site completes. 
The Marvel logo will bring you back to the home screen page for user.*
